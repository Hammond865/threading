<h2>Understanding this program</h2>
<p>This program will create a single "producer" thread, which passes information to a set number of "consumer" threads.
Specifically, it will pass the time elapsed since the program started. Every time the producer writes a number, and a consumer
reads it, that will be printed out to the console.</p>
